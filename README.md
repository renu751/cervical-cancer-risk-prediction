# 🩺 Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction API

An end-to-end **medical risk prediction system** built using machine learning, FastAPI, and Docker.  
The project focuses on **early cervical cancer risk screening**, with special emphasis on **reducing false negatives**, which is critical in healthcare applications.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers if detected early.  
The goal of this project is to build a **clinical decision-support system** that predicts cervical cancer risk based on patient medical and lifestyle factors.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Clean and preprocess real-world medical data
- Handle hidden missing values and class imbalance
- Optimize the model for **high recall**
- Deploy the model as a **REST API**
- Containerize the solution using **Docker**

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- **Dataset:** Cervical Cancer Risk Factors (Kaggle)
- **Target Variable:** `Biopsy` (0 = No risk, 1 = High risk)
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Optimization:** Class imbalance handled using `class_weight='balanced'`
- **Metric Focus:** Recall (to minimize missed cancer cases)

### 📊 Model Performance (Balanced Model)
- Recall (Cancer Class): **79%**
- False Negatives reduced from **5 → 3**
- Suitable for **screening and risk assessment**

---

## 🩺 Medical Importance
In healthcare screening systems:
- **False negatives are dangerous**
- **False positives are acceptable**

This project prioritizes **patient safety** by maximizing recall.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **FastAPI**
- **Docker**
- **Git & GitHub**
